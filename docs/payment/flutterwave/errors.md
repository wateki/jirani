Errors
Learn about our error codes and how to resolve them.

When you make an API request, errors can occur due to authentication failures, invalid input, or processing issues. It's important to handle these errors properly by understanding their structure, status codes, and related messages. You can explore the details below.

Error Structure
If thereâ€™s an issue with your request, the API returns a 4XX or 5XX HTTP status code along with a structured error response. This response includes information about what went wrong.

400 Bad Request

{
    "status": "failed",
    "error": {
        "type": "REQUEST_NOT_VALID",
        "code": "10400",
        "message": "Invalid card number",
        "validation_errors": []
