Webhooks
In a nutshell
Webhooks allow you to set up a notification system that can be used to receive updates on certain requests made to the Paystack API.

Introduction
Generally, when you make a request to an API endpoint, you expect to get a near-immediate response. However, some requests may take a long time to process, which can lead to timeout errors. In order to prevent a timeout error, a pending response is returned. Since your records need to be updated with the final state of the request, you need to either:

Make a request for an update (popularly known as polling) or,
Listen to events by using a webhook URL.
Helpful Tip
We recommend that you use webhook to provide value to your customers over using callbacks or polling. With callbacks, we don't have control over what happens on the customer's end. Neither do you. Callbacks can fail if the network connection on a customer's device fails or is weak or if the device goes off after a transaction.

Polling vs Webhooks
Image showing a comparison between polling and webhooks
Polling requires making a GET request at regular intervals to get the final status of a request. For example, when a customer makes a payment for a transaction, you keep making a request for the transaction status until you get a successful transaction status.

With webhooks, the resource server, Paystack in this case, sends updates to your server when the status of your request changes. The change in status of a request is known as an event. You’ll typically listen to these events on a POST endpoint called your webhook URL.

The table below highlights some differences between polling and webhooks:

Polling	Webhooks
Mode of update	Manual	Automatic
Rate limiting	Yes	No
Impacted by scaling	Yes	No
Create a webhook URL
A webhook URL is simply a POST endpoint that a resource server sends updates to. The URL needs to parse a JSON request and return a 200 OK:

NodePHP
// Using Express
app.post("/my/webhook/url", function(req, res) {
    // Retrieve the request's body
    const event = req.body;
    // Do something with event
    res.send(200);
});
When your webhook URL receives an event, it needs to parse and acknowledge the event. Acknowledging an event means returning a 200 OK in the HTTP header. Without a 200 OK in the response header, events are sent for the next 72 hours:

In live mode, webhook events are sent every 3 minutes for the first 4 tries, then retried hourly for the next 72 hours
In test mode, webhook events are sent hourly for 10 hours, with a request timeout of 30 seconds.
Avoid long-running tasks
If you have extra tasks in your webhook function, you should return a 200 OK response immediately. Long-running tasks lead to a request timeout and an automatic error response from your server. Without a 200 OK response, the retry as described in the proceeding paragraph.

Verify event origin
Since your webhook URL is publicly available, you need to verify that events originate from Paystack and not a bad actor. There are two ways to ensure events to your webhook URL are from Paystack:

Signature validation
IP whitelisting
Signature validation
Events sent from Paystack carry the x-paystack-signature header. The value of this header is a HMAC SHA512 signature of the event payload signed using your secret key. Verifying the header signature should be done before processing the event:


Node
const crypto = require('crypto');
const secret = process.env.SECRET_KEY;
// Using Express
app.post("/my/webhook/url", function(req, res) {
    //validate event
    const hash = crypto.createHmac('sha512', secret).update(JSON.stringify(req.body)).digest('hex');
    if (hash == req.headers['x-paystack-signature']) {
    // Retrieve the request's body
    const event = req.body;
    // Do something with event  
    }
    res.send(200);
});
IP whitelisting
With this method, you only allow certain IP addresses to access your webhook URL while blocking out others. Paystack will only send webhooks from the following IP addresses:

52.31.139.75
52.49.173.169
52.214.14.220
You should whitelist these IP addresses and consider requests from other IP addresses a counterfeit.

Whitelisting is domain independent
The IP addresses listed above are applicable to both test and live environments. You can whitelist them in your staging and production environments.

Go live checklist
Now that you’ve successfully created your webhook URL, here are some ways to ensure you get a delightful experience:

Add the webhook URL on your Paystack dashboard
Ensure your webhook URL is publicly available (localhost URLs cannot receive events)
If using .htaccess remember to add the trailing / to the URL
Test your webhook to ensure you’re getting the JSON body and returning a 200 OK HTTP response
If your webhook function has long-running tasks, you should first acknowledge receiving the webhook by returning a 200 OK before proceeding with the long-running tasks
If we don’t get a 200 OK HTTP response from your webhooks, we flagged it as a failed attempt
In the live mode, failed attempts are retried every 3 minutes for the first 4 tries, then retried hourly for the next 72 hours
In the test mode, failed attempts are retried hourly for the next 10 hours. The timeout for each attempt is 30 seconds.
