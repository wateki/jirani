Terms of Reference (ToR)
Concern Worldwide is an international non-governmental humanitarian organization dedicated to the reduction of suffering and working towards the ultimate elimination of extreme poverty in the world’s poorest countries
1. Background and Context
Concern Worldwide is an international humanitarian organization committed to reducing hunger and working towards the elimination of extreme poverty. Concern operates in some of the world’s most vulnerable and disaster-prone countries, with programs focused on emergency response, health and nutrition, livelihoods, education, and climate resilience. Concern is currently implementing a program in collaboration with Machakos County Government to strengthen the Orange-Fleshed Sweet Potato (OFSP) value chain, with a particular focus on increased OFSP production, value addition and strengthening of market linkages. As part of the initiative, the program seeks to enhance access to certified, drought-tolerant OFSP seed varieties for smallholder farmers within the county. The OFSP variety is a critical crop in addressing food security and nutrition (Vitamin A-Beta Carotine) ensuring the availability of quality planting materials in Machakos County. Orange-Fleshed Sweet potato (OFSP) has a precursor of Vitamin A and has been promoted as a key intervention in addressing micronutrient deficiencies, especially in vulnerable populations such as children and pregnant women.
Machakos County was selected for the project based on a comprehensive assessment of its potential for integration into the OFSP value chain. Key factors considered included (i) proximity to Nairobi, the economic and consumption hub, (ii) a suitable environment for OFSP production, (iii) high agricultural production potential, and (iv) the capacity and demand of the local community. Agriculture employs 75% of the County population. However, the lack of proper farming techniques has resulted in a harvest of less than 10 tons of OFSP per hectare, limiting farmers' income. With the adoption of appropriate agricultural techniques, yields can increase by at least 1.5 times, reaching 15–30 tons per hectare. The project, therefore, aims at directly or indirectly mitigating the effects of low agricultural productivity on farmers’ income and reducing high vulnerability to climate change. To ensure the effectiveness and sustainability of the project, a market-oriented value chain will be strengthened in the long term, ultimately contributing to improved food security and nutrition.
Despite the crop’s strong nutritional and market potential, farmers continue to face challenges including weak market linkages, limited access to timely market information, and poor coordination among market value chain actors. To address these challenges, the project seeks to engage a service provider to design, develop, and deploy a customized digital market platform specifically focused on addressing market access and linkage gaps within the OFSP value chain in Machakos County. The platform will connect OFSP farmers, buyers, and agricultural extension officers and promote transparent, efficient, and inclusive sales by enabling real-time order management and market information sharing. It is intended to serve as a sustainable, locally owned system to ensure long-term use and impact.
