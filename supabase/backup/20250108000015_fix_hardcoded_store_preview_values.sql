-- Frontend Fix: Remove hardcoded fashion-specific fallback values
-- This backup documents the frontend changes made to fix hardcoded "FIND CLOTHES THAT MATCHES YOUR STYLE" 
-- fallback values in store preview components.

-- CHANGES MADE TO FRONTEND:
-- File: src/components/store/StoreCollectionsPage.tsx
-- 
-- BEFORE (lines 81, 90):
-- {heroHeading || "FIND CLOTHES THAT MATCHES YOUR STYLE"}
-- {heroSubheading || "Browse through our diverse range of meticulously crafted garments, designed to bring out your individuality and cater to your sense of style."}
--
-- AFTER:
-- {heroHeading || "Welcome to Our Store"}
-- {heroSubheading || "Discover amazing products and services tailored just for you."}
--
-- REASON: The hardcoded fallback values were fashion/clothing specific and not relevant 
-- for other business types like supermarkets, electronics, restaurants, etc.
--
-- SOLUTION: Updated fallback values to be generic and business-type agnostic.
-- The proper business-type specific content now comes from the database templates
-- via the hero_heading and hero_subheading fields in store_settings table.

-- This ensures that:
-- 1. New stores automatically get relevant content from their business type templates
-- 2. Existing stores have been backfilled with appropriate content
-- 3. Fallback values are generic and work for any business type
-- 4. The store preview shows relevant content instead of fashion-specific text
